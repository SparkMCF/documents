<h1>Minecraft Forum Guidelines</h1>

Above all else Minecraft Forum serves to provide a safe, secure and family friendly environment for Minecraft fans of all ages to share and discover their love for Minecraft, through news, videos, downloadable content and discussion. A constructive, respectful and welcoming approach is required from all members at all times, in both forum posts and private conversations. The forum rules are a general guide about what we do and do not expect from members, it is not an exhaustive list and moderators will sometimes make decisions independent of the rules. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the rules please [Contact Us](http://www.minecraftforum.net/about/support). Thank you!

# Do

* __Be nice and polite__, every member deserves to be treated with respect. Positive and polite posts create a friendly and welcoming environment that all members will feel comfortable in.

* __Think before posting__, sensible, well thought-out and legible posts help other members understand what is being communicated.
  
* __Post in relevant sections__, posting in the most relevant section will ensure that each thread is seen by members most interested in the subject.

* __Remain on topic__, threads should remain on the topic of the opening post, a new thread should be created for any significant deviation from the topic.
  
* __Report rule violations__, reported content is sent to staff members for review, any content that needs moderator attention should be reported.

* __Abide by developers terms of service__, Minecraft is available on a variety of platforms authored by a variety of developers, each platform and developer has their own Terms of Service and Minecraft Forum members are required to abide by these at all times. This includes the [Mojang EULA](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula), [Xbox Terms Of Use](http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/Legal/LiveTOU), Sony [PlayStation 4](http://www.scei.co.jp/ps4-eula/), [PlayStation 3](http://www.scei.co.jp/ps3-eula/) and [PlayStation Vita](http://www.scei.co.jp/psvita-eula/) Terms of Service, [iTunes Store Terms and Conditions](http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html) and the [Google Play Terms of Service](https://play.google.com/about/play-terms.html).

# Do Not

* _Use Profanity_, profanity of any kind if not tolerated on the Minecraft Forum, this includes self censorship as well as acronyms.

* _Flame or Provoke_, flaming and provoking members on the forum deliberately to cause and argument is not permitted on the Minecraft Forum, every member should be welcome to his opinion but purposefully posting in hopes to cause an argument is against the rules.

* _Spam_, spam is not something people want to see when they browse the forum, therefore it is against the rules to post spam, which includes excessive links to your content, duplicate topics/posts, and off-topic content.

* _Behave in a Malicious Manor_, acting in a malicious manor is not to be tolerated, posting inappropriate material, posting harmful content and being rude and insultive to other members will be severely punshiable, it is important to be respectful to both members and staff, treat others as you would treat yourself.
